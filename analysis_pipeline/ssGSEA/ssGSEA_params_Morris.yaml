# Parameters for ssGSEA score calculation. A score will be given to every cell for every geneSet specicied
# Genesets can be either a full path to a text file with custom gene sets, or genesets from msigdb.
#### For a custom file, see the attached example genesets.txt file for the format
#### For pulling genesets from msigdb, see below:
# Format: ["<name_of_gene_set collection>,<a_regex_string_to_match_the_geneSets>", ...].
# Check https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp
# Check regex cheatsheet on how to write patterns: e.g., https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1665049611/Marketing/Blog/Regular_Expressions_Cheat_Sheet.pdf

### HEATMAP -  # A single heatmap with all pathways. Single grouping variable
# The heatmap of the ssGSEA values for all the genesets will be plotted against each of these groupby columns
groupby:
  - "ClusterID"
#  - "astro_neuro_only_plus_cond"
#  - "RNA_snn_res.0.1"
#  - "goi"

### Statistics
do_statistics: true  # Do this for a TSV file of statistics
statistics_groupby: batch  # which metadata column for stat testing.
statistics_groups_to_compare:  # OPTIONAL. comma separated of the format <group1_vs_group2,group4_vs_group3,...>
statistics_splitby: ClusterIDnew # OPTIONAL. Which metadata column to use for separating the datasets
statistics_multiple_comparisons_adjustment_method: "bonferroni"  # "holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY", "fdr", "none"
#### Volcano based on statistics. See above.
do_volcano: true  # This will only be run if statistics is done
