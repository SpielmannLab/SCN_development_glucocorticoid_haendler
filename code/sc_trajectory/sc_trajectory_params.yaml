# Details about conversion from seurat to monocle object:
assay: RNA # Which assay or count matrix to use. Some possible options include "RNA", "spliced", "unspliced". Recommended is RNA
keep_embeddings: true # TRUE/FALSE/true/false. Whether to transfer the embeddings (PCA and UMAP) from Seurat to monocle.
npcs: 20 # Numeric. If not transferring embeddings, how many PCA componenets to use for creating new embeddings

# Parameters about trajectory analysis
clustering_k: 10 # Numeric. 10 is a good value. Higher results in fewer clusters
seperate_trajectory_by_partition: false # logical. Whether trajectories should be disconnected between partitions
close_loop: false # logical. Whether circular trajectories are allowed
group_bys: "orig.ident,annotations,group,replicate" # comma separated metadata column names to colour cells by in umap/trajectory
pt_size: 1 # Size of dots in the umap/trajectory
width: 10 # width of umap/trajectory
height: 10 # Height of umap/trajectory
do_de_genenes_in_trajectory: false # Takes a long time. This calculates genes that show patterns of expression in the UMAP. Every found gene will get a MoransI coefficent. 

# Time=0 in pseudotime can be set in two ways. Using root_node value or using metadata_key/val pairs. 
# Pseudotime will only be run if either of the two is provided
# root_node are the "Y_" values generated in the trajectory plot
# The time=0 will be set accordingly
root_node: Y_1 # For the first run, this is usually unknown. Leave empty
# - OR -
root_metadata: # This can be provided if desired. For eg., if a particular cell group is known to be a progenitor

    val: 

# Genes to plot the expression vs psuedotime
# Note: for this, cells will be coloured based on first group_bys provided
genes: "MT1G,CXCL1,CXCL8,GRID2,KCNIP4,MT1H"
gex_genes_per_file: 4 # How many genes to be plotted per file
gex_pt_size: 0.5 # Size of points in the gene expression vs pseudotime plot. 0.5 is a good number to start with
gex_width: 7 # Width of the gene expression vs pseudotime plot
gex_height: 7 # Height of the gene expression vs pseudotime plot
